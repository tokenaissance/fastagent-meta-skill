# Creation Handoff

Use this structure after creating or materially redesigning a skill. Keep it concise enough to read in the final response, while preserving the fuller version in `reports/creation-handoff.md` for Production or higher.

## 1. Result

- skill name and version
- one-sentence job to be done
- local path and publication status

## 2. Reference skills studied

Name 2–4 genuinely relevant candidates. For each one include:

- skill and source link
- why it entered the shortlist
- dated adoption or trust signal, with metric semantics preserved
- concrete mechanism learned
- where that mechanism appears in the created skill

Do not list a candidate that was only seen in a search result but not inspected.

## 3. Absorbed and rejected

Summarize:

- `keep`: mechanism retained in principle
- `adapt`: mechanism changed for fastagent users, tools, language, or risk level
- `reject`: mechanism omitted and the concrete reason
- `invent`: original connection or capability created for this job

## 4. Advantages and highlights

Each advantage needs a label and evidence pointer:

| Label | Meaning | Allowed wording |
|---|---|---|
| `design advantage` | visible in the source/package and better aligned to the stated target job | “This design adds…” or “Compared with the inspected candidates, this package explicitly…” |
| `validated advantage` | supported by a named trigger, output, runtime, install, or human evaluation | “Passed 16/16 trigger cases…” |
| `hypothesis` | plausible but not yet proven | “Expected to help…, but provider-backed comparison is missing evidence.” |

Do not write “best,” “world-class,” “more accurate,” or “better than X” unless a fair comparison supports it. A checklist difference is not automatically an outcome advantage.

## 5. Verification and limits

Report:

- package validation
- trigger results
- output, runtime, or human evidence when available
- what remains `missing evidence`
- permissions or actions deliberately excluded
